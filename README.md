`*React library is Required`

One component that you can change into several other components as needed with the same style.


### Semi Polymorphic Components

<details open>
<summary>Getting Started</summary>

  
- Most of what we do is create simple - somewhat complex modules that can be used in a variety of projects.
- When you need a slightly complex component function, it's possible to add a library to get the function.
- Sometimes only for a few parts or even one part of the project but it's very important.
- In another section we need a similar code but with different conditions or components.
- We created a simple logic to combine only a few selected components or `semi polymorphic components`.
- Summarize several different components into one basic component according to the calling of the component name which will be followed by the default property.
- In the first case you use `NextButton` which contains anchor, button, and div components. By default the components we provide do not have initial values so you have to choose one of the three components.
- Whatever component you choose has one default style in common.



If you are using node, you can start it by running the development server:


```cirru
npm run dev
```

or

```cirru
yarn dev
```

or

```cirru
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the module by modifying `modules/.../index` file.

🚨 In practice, some of our syntax/code approach may be incompatible with the library and version you are using.
